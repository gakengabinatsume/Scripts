# Docker and Docker Swarm
**Docker is an open-source platform that allows you to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of applications using containerization.**

**Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration solution for Docker, enabling the management of multiple Docker hosts as a single virtual system.**

**Benefits of Docker:**
- Consistent environments: Docker ensures that applications run consistently across different environments, reducing the "it works on my machine" problem.
- Lightweight: Docker containers are lightweight and share the host OS kernel, resulting in faster startup times and efficient resource utilization.
- Scalability: Docker allows you to scale applications easily by running multiple instances of containers.
- Isolation: Containers provide isolation between applications, preventing conflicts and improving security.
  
**Docker Swarm Overview:**
- Docker Swarm is a native clustering and orchestration solution for Docker.
- It allows you to create and manage a swarm of Docker nodes, forming a single virtual system.
- Swarm provides features like service discovery, load balancing, and rolling updates.

**Key Features of Docker Swarm:**
- Service Discovery: Swarm provides a built-in DNS-based service discovery mechanism, allowing containers to find and communicate with each other.
- Load Balancing: Swarm distributes incoming requests across containers, ensuring high availability and scalability.
- Rolling Updates: Swarm enables rolling updates of services, ensuring zero downtime during application updates.
- Scaling: Swarm allows you to scale services up or down based on demand, ensuring optimal resource utilization.

**Here are some main commands for each:**

**Docker:**
1. docker run: This command is used to run a container from a specific image.
2. docker build: It is used to build an image from a Dockerfile.
3. docker pull: This command pulls an image from a registry.
4. docker push: It pushes an image to a registry.
5. docker stop: It stops a running container.
6. docker rm: This command removes a container.
7. docker ps: It lists all running containers.
8. docker images: It lists all available images.
9. docker exec: This command runs a command inside a running container.
10. docker logs: It displays the logs of a container.

**Docker Swarm:**
1. docker swarm init: This command initializes a swarm and creates a manager node.
2. docker swarm join: It joins a node to a swarm as a worker or manager.
3. docker service create: This command creates a new service in the swarm.
4. docker service ls: It lists all services running in the swarm.
5. docker service scale: This command scales the number of replicas for a service.
6. docker service update: It updates the configuration of a service.
7. docker node ls: It lists all nodes in the swarm.
8. docker stack deploy: This command deploys a stack defined in a Compose file.
9. docker stack ls: It lists all stacks running in the swarm.
10. docker stack rm: This command removes a stack from the swarm.

Please note that these are just a few examples, and there are many more commands available for Docker and Docker Swarm. 
You can refer to the official documentation [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/) .

**Exemple:**

1. We can create an image from a docker file and index.html 
```
cd Docker\ project/

docker build -t gabimiron96/gakengabinatsume .
```
2. Then push it into DockerHub so that others will be able to pull it
```
docker push gabimiron96/gakengabinatsume:latest
```
```
docker pull gabimiron96/gakengabinatsume:latest
```
3. With the same docker file we can create a different image by changing the index.html file and push it as well
```
docker build -t gabimiron96/gakengabinatsume:Beta .
```
```
docker push gabimiron96/gakengabinatsume:Beta
```
